# Java Mini Projects Repository

This repository showcases a collection of Java mini projects focused on **core programming concepts** and **object-oriented design**. Each project highlights practical implementations of Java's versatile features and demonstrates skills in GUI handling, event-driven programming, and cryptography.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Email Generator
- **Description**: A tool to generate email addresses programmatically based on given user data.
- **Key Features**:
  - Validates input data.
  - Supports dynamic domain selection.
  - Generates and stores unique email IDs.

### 2. Mouse Events Handler
- **Description**: An interactive GUI application that tracks and responds to mouse events.
- **Key Features**:
  - Detects mouse clicks, movements, and drags.
  - Visual feedback for different events.
  - Customizable event-handling actions.

### 3. Digital Signature Generator
- **Description**: A cryptography-based tool to generate and verify digital signatures for secure communication.
- **Key Features**:
  - Implements RSA for encryption and decryption.
  - Generates secure keys.
  - Ensures data integrity and authenticity.
 
### 4.Currency Converter

This **Currency Converter** is a Java-based application that allows users to perform currency conversions between multiple international currencies, including USD, EUR, GBP, CHF, CNY, and JPY. It uses `HashMap` to store predefined exchange rates, supports initializing currencies with default values, and performs precise conversions with encapsulated methods for managing currency details.

## Features
- Represents currencies with their full names and short codes (e.g., "US Dollar" - "USD").
- Stores and manages exchange rates using a `HashMap`.
- Includes methods to initialize default exchange rates and perform conversions.
- Encapsulation of currency properties using getters and setters.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization:** A list of predefined currencies is created with default exchange rates.
2. **Conversion:** Converts any amount from one currency to another using these exchange rates.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Data Structures:** `ArrayList`, `HashMap`


## Key Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Java AWT and Swing for GUI development.
  - Java Security Package for cryptography.
